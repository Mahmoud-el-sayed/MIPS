 32-bit single cycle microarchitecture MIPS Risk processor based on Harvard architecture using Verilog HDL.

The implementation consists of 4 main blocks:
1. Data Path.
2. Control Unit.
3. Instruction Memory.
4. Data Memory.

The simulation was performed on Modelsim using the following three programs written in machine code following MIPS ISA:
Program 1: GCD of 120 and 180.
Program 2: Factorial Number of 7.
Program 3: The Fibonacci series numbers
